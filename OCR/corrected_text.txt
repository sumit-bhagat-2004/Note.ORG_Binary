Education First
It has always been a dream of mine, a world where every girl or boy, holding books in their hands, wearing school uniforms and going to school. I dream and constantly struggle to make this today's reality. I, myself, always believe that even one pen, one child, one teacher can change the world. - Malala Yousafzai
