Chandrayaan-2 Failure\n   - The second lunar mission, Chandrayaan-2, failed due to a last-minute technical glitch.\n   - The lander Vikram, which was part of the mission, lost contact with the ground station just 2.1 km above the lunar surface.\n   - ISRO was unable to restore communication with the lander, leading to the mission's failure.\n\n3. Rebounding with Chandrayaan-3\n   - Despite the setback with Chandrayaan-2, ISRO launched its third lunar mission, Chandrayaan-3.\n   - The mission showed improvements and learned from the failures of the previous mission.\n   - ISRO's perseverance and resilience were highlighted in the successful execution of Chandrayaan-3.\n\n4. Learning from Failures\n   - The failure of Chandrayaan-2 was considered a part of the game in the space industry.\n   - ISRO used the lessons learned from this failure to enhance their future space missions.\n\n5. Overall, ISRO's lunar missions represent the organization's commitment to pushing the boundaries of India's space exploration capabilities."
