Handwriting is an essential skill for both children and adults (Feder & Majnemer, 2007). Even in the age of technology, it remains the primary tool of communication and knowledge assessment for students in the classroom. The demands for it are great, whether in the classroom or beyond. A 1992 study (McHale & Cermak) found that 85 percent of all fine motor time in second, fourth, and sixth-grade classrooms was spent on paper and pencil activities. A more recent study (Man, Cermak, Cohn & Henderson, 2003) noted that kindergarten children are now spending 42 percent of their fine motor time on paper and pencil activities.

The addition of handwritten components to many state standards assessments and of a handwritten essay to the College Board SAT in 2005 further emphasizes the importance of handwriting. Furthermore, good handwriting is important long after graduation. In "Script and Scribble" (2009), Florey writes in reference to handwritten job applications, "Like it or not, even in our machine-driven world, people still judge you by your handwriting."

Research literature extensively documents the consequences of poor handwriting on early literacy and academic performance. Children who experience difficulty mastering this skill may suffer.
